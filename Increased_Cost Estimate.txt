With an increased budget, we decide to:
* Have a hot disaster recovery in region US east Ohio
* Use IOPS SSD for the RDS servers, as well as the EC2 instances
* Change S3 media files policy to keep them longer in Standard S3 vs IA

Other possible changes
* increasing RDS memory
* using another RDS read replica per AZ to offload the read/write master database (possibly requiring application changes)
